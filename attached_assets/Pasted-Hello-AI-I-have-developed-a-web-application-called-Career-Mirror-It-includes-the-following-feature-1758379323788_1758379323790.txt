Hello AI, I have developed a web application called Career Mirror. It includes the following features and components:

1. Core Features:

Career Doppelgänger Matching (show career paths of similar profiles)

Skill Gap Analysis + Course Recommendations (Coursera, Udemy, LinkedIn Learning APIs)

Lifestyle Simulation (Salary, Work-Life Balance, Stress, Travel, Career Progression)

AI Career Guidance (GPT-based “Future Self” advice)

Interactive Career Map Dashboard

Continuous Feedback Loop (users update progress → system improves recommendations)

2. Architecture:

Frontend: Next.js + TailwindCSS + Framer Motion + Recharts

Backend: FastAPI or Node.js (Express)

Database: PostgreSQL + Vector DB (Pinecone/Weaviate)

AI Layer: GPT + embeddings for profile similarity

Cloud Storage: AWS S3 / GCP / Supabase

Authentication: Auth0 or Supabase Auth

Analytics: PostHog or Mixpanel

3. Data Pipeline:

Sources: O*NET, ESCO, LinkedIn, Kaggle datasets, Stack Overflow, GitHub, Coursera APIs

Preprocessing: skill extraction, job normalization, embeddings, optional synthetic data

Storage: PostgreSQL (structured) + Vector DB (embeddings)

4. Matching & Recommendations:

Parse CV / LinkedIn / skills

Query Vector DB → top 10 career doppelgängers

Highlight skill gaps + recommend courses

Lifestyle simulation (salary, hours, stress)

GPT-generated AI narrative (“future self” view)

5. Frontend UX:

Career dashboard with tabs: Doppelgängers, Career Map, Skill Gaps, Lifestyle Simulation

Gamification: badges, milestones

Notifications: email/SMS reminders

6. Unique Differentiators:

Career Doppelgängers, Lifestyle Simulator, Future Self AI Narrative, Dynamic Skill-Job Graph

7. Implementation Roadmap: MVP → Phase 2 → Phase 3 (full features, community, analytics)

8. Guardrails: Transparency, data privacy, approximate lifestyle simulations

9. Deliverables: Full-stack web app, PostgreSQL + Vector DB schema, ETL scripts, AI endpoints, frontend components

My Question to AI:

Can you check and tell me: Does this built Career Mirror web application include all the above features correctly, or is anything missing or incomplete?
